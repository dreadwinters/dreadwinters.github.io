If you are a member on The Microsoft Agent Frontier Empire then you most likely would recognize this.

The only known websites that are hosting this Fork are tmafe.com (konnor88, offline) and bonkeyword.tk (ius)

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run your own BonziWORLD, by all means go ahead. Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

## Dependencies
- Node.js and npm
- Ruby
- Sass
- Git
- Cordova (Optional)
- [Microsoft Speech API 4.0](https://github.com/TETYYS/SAPI4/blob/master/spchapi.exe?raw=true)
- [Lernout & Hauspie TruVoice American English voices](https://github.com/TETYYS/SAPI4/raw/master/tv_enua.exe?raw=true)

## Setup
In a terminal/command prompt, navigate to where you'd like BonziWORLD to be placed and run the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/Seamusmario/BonziWORLD-Revived
cd BonziWORLD
```

### Client
This part is unneeded. An pre-built version is available.

### Server
```
cd bwr_server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)

## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you screw up anything with your computer while setting this up. I have no idea how you would, but someone will find a way. I also will not provide support for installing dependencies. If you have everything installed properly, the above commands will work.
